# Omnia Radix
This repository is the umbrella for Omnia Radix with issue tracking and feature requests and pointers to other resources.

## What is Radix?
It's a Platform-as-a-Service that offers testing, building, deploying, running and monitoring of your software.

The goal is to automate "the boring stuff" and let developers focus on business logic and features and offloading a lot of the tooling and automation to Radix.

#### Code ####
All of our source code for the platform is on [private GitHub repositories prefixed with *radix-*](https://github.com/Statoil?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=radix-) . You need to be a member of the *Omnia Radix Readers* group to have access. Contact us to get access.

#### Jira ####
We have a [Jira board](https://statoil.atlassian.net/) for tracking progress in the team. Right now this is internal for the team only.
