Short summary of what beta channel means:
  - No guarantees of uptime or correctness, but we strive to not break things on purpose. 
  - No guarantees of response or resolution times for questions and support, but we will respond as soon as we are able to.
  - New cluster based on latest code every week. Old clusters will live on for 1-2 weeks after that before being terminated. We will try to make migrations of customer applications to new clusters as seamless as possible.
