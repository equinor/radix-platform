# Get to know Radix

The basic requirements are covered in [Getting started](guides/getting-started).

The most beginner-friendly way to get started is the [Configuring an app](guides/configure-an-app) guide. You can also watch the [Introduction to Radix video](https://statoilsrm.sharepoint.com/portals/hub/_layouts/15/PointPublishing.aspx?app=video&p=p&chid=653b6223-6ef5-4e5b-8388-ca8c77da4c7a&vid=3a64412f-0227-489d-9fda-f5f9845aacae) üé• for a more visual overview.

We also have a collection of [scenarios](guides/scenarios) that can be used as templates for new or existing projects.

# Building and deploying

How should you set up Git branches and Radix environments? Read about [workflows](guides/workflows/) for an overview.

Builds in Radix are Docker builds! The [Docker builds](guides/docker/) guide has recommendations for creating good `Dockerfile`s that work well in the cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è

# Monitoring

You can use monitoring "out of the box" (the link to Grafana is in the top-right corner of the [Web Console](https://console.radix.equinor.com)). But you will get the most value by implementing [monitoring relevant for your app](guides/monitoring).
