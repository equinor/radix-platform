# What is Radix?

Omnia Radix is a Platform-as-a-Service ("PaaS", if you like buzzwords). It builds, deploys, and monitors applications, automating the boring stuff and letting you focus on your code. Applications run in <abbr title="someone else's computer">the cloud</abbr> as Docker containers, in environments that you define.

# Requirements

There aren't many requirements: Radix runs applications written in Python, Java, .NET, JavaScript, or [LOLCODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE) equally well. If it can be built and deployed as Docker containers you are nearly ready. If not, it's not hard to "dockerise" most applications: we have guides [TODO: link] and [human help]({% link community.md %}) on hand.

An in-depth understanding of Docker is not a requirement, but it helps to be familiar with the concepts of containers and images. There are many beginner tutorials online, here's one of the most straightforward: [Getting Started with Docker
](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-docker).

It is also expected that you have a [basic understanding of Git](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) (branching, merging) and some networking (ports, domain names).

# Setting up

What you need to get your application in Radix:

- A GitHub repository for your code (only GitHub is supported at the moment)
- A `radixconfig.yaml` file that defines the running environments. This must be in the root directory of your repository.
- At least one `Dockerfile` that builds and serves your application. You can have several of these files: one per component, in separate directories (e.g. a "front-end" component and a "back-end" component).

We will go over these points below.

## Your repository

There are only a couple of rules in place.

First, all of your application's **components must be in the same repository**. They will be built and deployed together. There is currently no concept of a multi-repository application.

Second, **each environment is mapped to a branch**. This means that, for instance, your `dev` environment might be built and deployed from `master`, while a `prod` environment can be built and deployed from the `production` branch.

A single branch can be mapped to multiple environments. You can also use any branching strategy: Radix won't do anything with branches unless they are mapped to an environment. But you will want a workflow that includes changes being merged to your environment-mapped branches.

## The `radixconfig.yaml` file

This is the Radix configuration file, which specifies how your application is built and deployed. It must be placed in the root of your repository.

> Radix only reads `radixconfig.yaml` from the `master` branch. Changes to this file on other branches (even branches that are mapped to environments) are ignored.

If you are unfamiliar with YAML, it is fine to write the configuration as JSON instead â€” just keep the same filename.

Here is a simple example of this file:

```yaml
apiVersion: radix.equinor.com/v1
kind: RadixApplication
metadata:
  name: my-cool-app
spec:
  environments:
    - name: dev
    - name: prod
  components:
    - name: main
      src: "."
      public: true
      ports:
       - name: http
         port: 80
```

And the same, but as JSON:

```json
{
   "apiVersion": "radix.equinor.com/v1",
   "kind": "RadixApplication",
   "metadata": { "name": "my-cool-app" },
   "spec": {
      "environments": [
         { "name": "dev" },
         { "name": "prod" }
      ],
      "components": [
         {
            "name": "main",
            "src": ".",
            "public": true,
            "ports": [
               { "name": "http", "port": 80 }
            ]
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

The syntax for this file is explained in the [full documentation](https://github.com/Statoil/radix-operator/blob/master/docs/radixconfig.md).
