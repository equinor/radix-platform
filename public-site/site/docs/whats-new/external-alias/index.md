# Introduction

We have introduced a new configuration in the `radixconfig.yaml` file for having user defined aliases. For information on how to configure that, see the documentation for the [`dnsExternalAlias` setting](../../reference-radix-config/#dnsExternalAlias) in the `radixconfig.yaml` file.
