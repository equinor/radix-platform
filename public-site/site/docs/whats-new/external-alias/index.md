# Introduction

We have introduced a new configuration in the `radixconfig.yaml` file for having user defined aliases, provided developers bring the corresponding certificate. For information on how to configure that, see the documentation for the [`dnsExternalAlias` setting](../../reference-radix-config/#dnsexternalalias) in the `radixconfig.yaml` file.

# How-to set certificate



# Whats next

We will do some work to list the defined external aliases in a future feature.
